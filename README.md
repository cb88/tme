The purpose of this project is to mirror code at: 

	http://people.csail.mit.edu/fredette/tme/tme-0.8.tar.gz

I haven't contacted the original developer but will get around to it once I have something to show.

1. My todo is to fix Linux and uptodate GCC support, 
2 .Perhaps remove libltdl, convert it to libdl or something to improve the situation.
3. Change GUI to SDL like QEMU since gtk is a sinking bloatship.
4. Improve non BSD networking.

Currently im only going to work on 1.  if someone else wants to work on the rest feel free!

Of course I'll mark 1. done when its done and move on.
