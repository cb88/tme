<h2>Introduction</h2>

<a href="index.html">The Machine Emulator</a>, or <tt>tme</tt>, is a
program that provides a general-purpose framework for computer
emulation.  <tt>tme</tt> can emulate Sun 3 VME systems based on the
"Carrera" motherboard, like the 3/150.
<p>

<hr>
<a name="getting">
<h2>Getting the <tt>tme</tt> software</h2>

<ol>

<li>
Find a reasonably fast machine to be the host.  A 500MHz Pentium III
seems to give performance close to a 3/150.
<p>

<li>
Follow all of the instructions for getting, building, and installing
<tt>tme</tt> found under
<a href="index.html">http://csail.mit.edu/~fredette/tme/</a>.  If
you want the emulated 3/150 to have network access, be sure to follow
the instructions about enabling <tt>tme</tt> to access the network.
<p>

<li>
Download the Sun 3 Carrera Revision 3.0 ROM:
<p>
<a href="sun3-carrera-rev-3.0.bin">http://csail.mit.edu/~fredette/tme/sun3-carrera-rev-3.0.bin</a>
<p>
<b>If Sun asks me to stop distributing this ROM, I will.</b>
<p>

</ol>

<a name="data">
<h2>Making the machine-specific data</h2>

It's best to create a new working directory for each emulated machine
you create.  This directory will contain the configuration files and
disk image for that machine.
<p>

In general, any working directory filename that begins with
<tt>my-</tt> or <tt>MY-</tt> is a file that is specific to your
individual emulated machine.  With the exception of the disk image,
these are mostly text files, and you are encouraged to edit many of
them to suit yourself.

<pre>
% <b>mkdir /some/where/my-sun3</b>
% <b>cd /some/where/my-sun3</b>
</pre>

<p>
Now populate this directory:

<ol>

<li>
Copy the SUN3-CARRERA machine description file into the working directory:

<pre>
% <b>cp /usr/pkg/share/examples/tme/SUN3-CARRERA ./MY-SUN3</b>
</pre>

This file contains <tt>tmesh</tt> commands that create a Sun 3/150.
If you don't change this file, it creates a Sun 3/150 with a bwtwo
framebuffer, a cgthree framebuffer, type-3 keyboard and mouse, one disk
drive, one tape drive, and no network interface.
<p>

If you can't use the emulated framebuffers (because, for example,
you aren't running X or didn't build <tt>tme</tt> with GTK), you must
edit this file to disable the GTK-based display and enable the serial
console instead.  Comments in the <tt>MY-SUN3</tt> file should explain
how to do this.

<li>
Copy the ROM image into the working directory:

<pre>
% <b>cp /some/where/sun3-carrera-rev-3.0.bin .</b>
</pre>
<p>

<li>
Make a Sun 3 IDPROM file in the working directory:
<p>
The <tt>tme-sun-idprom</tt> Perl script makes Sun IDPROM files.
Before you can run it, you must choose an Ethernet address for your
emulator - <em>even if <tt>tme</tt> won't have access to the
network</em>.  Ethernet addresses for Sun workstations always begin
with <tt>8:0:20</tt>, so pick three hexadecimal bytes
<tt>XX:YY:ZZ</tt> such that <tt>8:0:20:XX:YY:ZZ</tt> is not taken by
any other machine on your LAN.
<p>
<pre>
% <b>tme-sun-idprom 3/150 8:0:20:XX:YY:ZZ &gt; my-sun3-idprom.bin</b>
</pre>
<p>

<li>
Make a Sun 3 EEPROM file in the working directory:
<p>
The <tt>tme-sun-eeprom</tt> Perl script makes Sun EEPROM files
from a text description.  To get a basic text description for a
Carrera system:
<p>
<pre>
% <b>cp /usr/pkg/share/examples/tme/sun3-carrera-eeprom.txt ./my-sun3-eeprom.txt</b>
</pre>
<p>
Most of the values should be left alone.  However, if you are using a serial
console, change <tt>console-device</tt> to <tt>ttya</tt>, and if you change 
the size of the <tt>ram0</tt> memory in your <tt>MY-SUN3</tt> file, you need
to change the <tt>installed-#megs</tt> value to match.
<p>
For the curious, some more documentation for many of the values in this file
can be found <a href="http://docs.sun.com/app/docs/doc/802-1930-1M/6i5u98e27?a=view">here</a>.
<p>
Once you're satisfied with the contents of your <tt>my-sun3-eeprom.txt</tt>
file, convert it into the binary EEPROM image:
<p>
<pre>
% <b>tme-sun-eeprom &lt; my-sun3-eeprom.txt &gt; my-sun3-eeprom.bin</b>
</pre>
<p>

<li>
If you do want to use the GTK-based display, copy the Sun keyboards
map, and keyboard macros file into the working directory:

<pre>
% <b>cp /usr/pkg/share/examples/tme/sun-keyboards.txt .</b>
% <b>cp /usr/pkg/share/examples/tme/my-sun-macros.txt ./my-sun-macros.txt</b>
</pre>

You should not edit the <tt>sun-keyboards.txt</tt> file, however you may want
to edit the <tt>my-sun-macros.txt</tt> file.  The two files work together to
transform key events on your keyboard into Sun type-3 scan codes.
<p>

The <tt>sun-keyboards.txt</tt> file lists all of the symbols (in X
terminology, all of the "keysyms") on a Sun type-3 keyboard, and gives
for each keysym a Sun type-3 scan code and some modifier information.
Because Sun type-3 keyboards are never going to change, you shouldn't
change this file, even if you think it lists keysyms that your
keyboard doesn't have, like <tt>L1</tt>, <tt>R11</tt>, etc.
<p>

The <tt>my-sun-macros.txt</tt> file is meant to adapt your keyboard 
to the Sun type-3 keyboard.  Any keysyms that the Sun type-3 keyboard
has, that your keyboard doesn't have, can be generated by macros added
to this file.  For example, <tt>tmesh</tt> may complain that:

<pre>
[/display0.0]: cannot generate keysym 'R9' directly, or through a macro: No such file or directory
</pre>

The odds are good that you don't care about generating the <tt>R9</tt> key -
it's one of the keysyms on the strange, original Sun numeric keypad.  But
if you absolutely must be able to generate the <tt>R9</tt> key, you could
add a line similar to the following to your <tt>my-sun-macros.txt</tt> file:

<pre>
Alt_R F9 = R9
</pre>

Then, you could simulate pressing <tt>R9</tt> by pressing the right
<tt>Alt</tt> key and then the <tt>F9</tt> key.
<p>

The <tt>my-sun-macros.txt</tt> that you copied from <tt>sun-macros.txt</tt>
contains a small number of macros for generating the <tt>L1</tt>, <tt>L2</tt>,
etc., keys.  These macros should be sufficient for general use - simply ignore
the <tt>tmesh</tt> warnings about other, obscure keysyms.
<p>

Under X, to learn about the keysyms present on your keyboard, the
<tt>xmodmap -pk</tt> command will print out your current keyboard map.
Alternately, the <tt>xev</tt> command may be a more convenient way
to see what key combinations on your keyboard generate which keysyms.
<p>

<li>
Create the empty disk image file.  Decide how big you want the emulated
disk to be, in bytes, and substitute that number for <i>NNNNNNNN</i> below:

<pre>
% <b>dd if=/dev/zero of=my-sun3-disk.img bs=1 count=1 seek=</b><i>NNNNNNNN</i>
</pre>

It's not immediately wasteful to choose a very large disk size - this
<tt>dd</tt> command will create a disk image that initially takes up
almost zero real space on your host's disk.  Only as the disk is populated
will your host's operating system allocate more real space to the image.
<p>

</ol>

<a name="install">
<h2>Installing NetBSD 1.6.2</h2>

Installing NetBSD in the emulator is very similar to installing it on
a real Sun 3/150.  This is good, because it allows developers to
experience and debug installation problems in the emulator.  This is
also bad, because the installation procedure can be long and
intimidating.
<p>

<a name="install-tape">
<h3>Making a virtual NetBSD tape</h3>

NetBSD installation on <tt>tme</tt> uses some classic tape procedures.
You will create a single virtual tape that boots the emulator into a
RAM disk kernel for labeling your virtual disk and copying a miniroot
to it, and this tape will also contain the NetBSD binary sets that the
miniroot will install onto the virtual disk.
<p>

Each segment of a <tt>tme</tt> virtual tape is really a regular file
on your host machine.  Start by creating a new directory, under your
working directory, to hold the contents of this tape:

<pre>
% <b>cd /some/where/my-sun3</b>
% <b>mkdir my-tape</b>
% <b>cd my-tape</b>
</pre>

Now download the <a href="http://www.netbsd.org/Releases/formal-1.6/">NetBSD 1.6.2</a>
official sun3 release.  <i>Please</i> use a <a href="http://www.netbsd.org/mirrors/#ftp">mirror</a>
close to you.
<p>

The files you want to download and place in the <tt>my-tape</tt>
directory are:

<ul>
<li>From the <tt>sun3/installation/tapeimage</tt> directory: <tt>tapeboot</tt>
<li>From the <tt>sun3/binary/kernel</tt> directory: <tt>netbsd.RAMDISK.gz</tt>
<li>From the <tt>sun3/installation/miniroot</tt> directory: <tt>miniroot.fs.gz</tt>
<li>From the <tt>sun3/binary/sets</tt> directory: <tt>base.tgz</tt>, <tt>etc.tgz</tt>, <tt>kern-GENERIC.tgz</tt>, and any other
binary sets that you want to install.
</ul>
<p>

Now, your <tt>my-tape</tt> directory should have the following contents:

<pre>
% <b>ls</b>
base.tgz            kern-GENERIC.tgz    netbsd.RAMDISK.gz
etc.tgz             miniroot.fs.gz      tapeboot
</pre>

Since decompression is extremely slow on any Sun 3, it's best to decompress
these files on the host:

<pre>
% <b>gzip -d *z</b>
% <b>ls</b>
base.tar            kern-GENERIC.tar    netbsd.RAMDISK
etc.tar             miniroot.fs         tapeboot
</pre>

Now we will create the virtual tape.  Although this isn't necessary,
for convenience we will make numbered symlinks to these files.  The
numbers will correspond to positions, or segments, on the virtual
tape, and we will then use those symlink names with <tt>tme</tt>:

<pre>
% <b>ln -s tapeboot ./01</b>
% <b>ln -s netbsd.RAMDISK ./02</b>
% <b>touch ./03</b>
% <b>ln -s miniroot.fs ./04</b>
% <b>ln -s base.tar ./05</b>
% <b>ln -s etc.tar ./06</b>
% <b>ln -s kern-GENERIC.tar ./07</b>
</pre>

Create additional symlinks for any additional binary sets that
you downloaded and want to install.
<p>

(Note that tape segment three is empty.  On a real NetBSD boot tape, it
would be the <tt>RAMDISK</tt> kernel for sun3x systems.)
<p>

<a name="install-rd">
<h3>Booting and using the NetBSD/sun3 <tt>RAMDISK</tt> kernel</h3>

Now that you have created the virtual tape, you must boot it.  This will
run the NetBSD/sun3 <tt>RAMDISK</tt> kernel.  This kernel has a very minimal
set of utilities that will allow you to label the virtual disk and copy
the miniroot to it.
<p>

<ol>
<li>
Start the emulator.  <b>Remember, if you're running a
statically-linked, uninstalled emulator, you must have the environment
variable <tt>LTDL_LIBRARY_PATH</tt> set to the top of your build
tree:</b>
<p>

<tt>% <b>cd /some/where/my-sun3</b></tt><br>
<tt>% <b>tmesh ./MY-SUN3</b></tt><br>
<i>ignore any <tt>cannot generate keysym</tt> warnings</i></br>
<tt>tmesh&gt;</tt>
<p>

The emulator itself is called <tt>tmesh</tt>.  <tt>tmesh</tt> is a
shell for running commands that create and control emulated machines.
One day, you will be able to create and manage a whole set
of emulated machines running inside the same <tt>tmesh</tt> process,
but for now it's only been tested to handle one machine.
<p>

<tt>tmesh</tt> takes one argument on its command line: the name of a
text file containing initial commands for it to execute.  In this
case, <tt>MY-SUN3</tt> contains commands to assemble a Sun 3/150.
<p>

Two new, rather blank GTK windows should appear on your screen.  If you
see any error messages, hopefully they're descriptive enough to help
you figure out what went wrong.  Usually, the first error listed is
the real problem; when a central element of the emulated Sun 3/150
can't be created, many subsequent errors will be generated because all
of the attachments to that central element also fail.
<p>

If you don't see any error messages, at this <tt>tmesh&gt;</tt>
prompt, give the <tt>ls</tt> command.  This should give the following
output:

<pre>
tmesh&gt; <b>ls</b>

</pre>
<p>

If the output contains all of these entries, the next step is to 
load the virtual tape into the tape drive (be sure to add any additional
tape segments corresponding to additional binary sets that you want
to install):

<pre>
tmesh&gt; <b>command tape0 load my-tape/01 my-tape/02 my-tape/03 my-tape/04 my-tape/05 my-tape/06 my-tape/07</b>
</pre>

<li>
Now you should be able to power up the emulated Sun 3:

<pre>
tmesh&gt; <b>command mainbus0 power up</b>
</pre>

After a while (the Sun 3 PROM does a good power-on self-test), you should see
something like this:
<p>

<img src="sun3-150-nbsd-0.png" alt="Initial PROM banner">
<p>

At the end of the output, the single <tt>&gt;</tt> is the Sun PROM
monitor prompt.  The <tt>No label found</tt> error is normal - the PROM
tried to automatically boot the virtual disk that you created earlier
with <tt>dd</tt>.  Because the disk is empty, the blocks that normally
contain the disk label are undefined.
<p>

Now, tell the PROM to boot the tape.  This is typed at the Sun PROM
<tt>&gt;</tt> prompt, <em>not</em> at the <tt>tmesh&gt;</tt> prompt:

<pre>
&gt; <b>b st()</b>
</pre>

After a short delay, the PROM should begin booting the virtual tape:
<p>

<img src="sun3-150-nbsd-1.png" alt="Loading the RAMDISK kernel">
<p>

Once the RAMDISK kernel has been loaded into memory, it starts booting.  
After the RAMDISK kernel has booted, it will display
a welcome message and leave you at an <tt>ssh:</tt> (for "Simple
Shell") prompt:
<p>

<img src="sun3-150-nbsd-2.png" alt="The ssh prompt">
<p>

<li>
Now you should follow the traditional
<a href="ftp://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/NetBSD-1.6.2/sun3/INSTALL.html">
NetBSD/sun3 installation procedure</a>, with respect to labeling the disk
and copying the miniroot to it.  To summarize:
<p>

<ul>
<li>Label the disk with <tt>edlabel /dev/rsd0c</tt>.  Remember,
all partitions that you create <em>must</em> begin on cylinder boundaries,
because the classic Sun disklabel format requires it.  NetBSD will
assign a geometry to the virtual disk (since the virtual disk does not
report one), and you can find the sectors per cylinder value inside
<tt>edlabel</tt>.
<p>
<li>Copy the miniroot to the swap partition of the disk:
<pre>
ssh: <b>mt -f /dev/nrst0 rewind</b>
ssh: <b>mt -f /dev/nrst0 fsf 3</b>
ssh: <b>dd bs=32k if=/dev/nrst0 of=/dev/rsd0b</b>
</pre>
<li>Halt the <tt>RAMDISK</tt> kernel, exiting back to the PROM:
<pre>
ssh: <b>halt</b>
</pre>
</ul>

</ol>

<a name="install-miniroot">
<h3>Booting the miniroot and running the <tt>install</tt> script</h3>

The next step is to boot the miniroot you copied to the swap partition
of your virtual disk, and run the <tt>install</tt> script it contains 
to do the actual NetBSD installation.

<ol>

<li>At the PROM prompt, boot the miniroot:
<pre>
&gt; <b>b sd(,,1) -s</b>
</pre>
<p>

<li>When the miniroot is done booting, it will leave you at a
single-user mode prompt.  To begin the real NetBSD installation,
run the <tt>install</tt> command, and follow the normal
<a href="ftp://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/NetBSD-1.6.2/sun3/INSTALL.html">
NetBSD/sun3 installation procedure</a>.  Some notes and hints:
<p>

<ul>
<li>It takes a very long time for <tt>newfs</tt> to make filesystems.
(This is true even on a real Sun 3.)
<p>
<li>Unless you've set up Ethernet access for <tt>tmesh</tt>, answer
<b><tt>n</tt></b> when <tt>install</tt> asks you <tt>Configure the network?</tt>.
<p>
<blockquote>
<b>WARNING</b>: There is a bug in NetBSD/sun3 versions 1.6, 1.6.1,
1.6.2, and 2.0 that will cause a panic in the <tt>INSTALL</tt> kernel
if you attempt to configure the <tt>ie0</tt> network interface.  (This
is true even on a real Sun 3.) The bug does not affect the
<tt>GENERIC</tt> kernel, so to avoid the bug, just don't configure the
network during the install procedure.  You can safely configure the
network after the system has been installed and you have changed the
kernel from INSTALL to GENERIC.
</blockquote>
<li>When asked <tt>Install from (f)tp, (t)ape, (C)D-ROM, (N)FS</tt>,
select <tt>t</tt> for tape.  The tape device is <tt>nrst0</tt>.  Start
with file number <tt>5</tt>, corresponding to <tt>base.tar</tt>.  This
set will take the longest - around two hours on a 500MHz machine.
After this set has been installed, install the other sets, at tape
file numbers <tt>6</tt>, <tt>7</tt>, etc.
<p>
<li>It takes a very long time for <tt>MAKEDEV</tt> to make devices.
(This is true even on a real Sun 3.)
</ul>
<p>

<li>Once <tt>install</tt> is done, it will leave you at the <tt>#</tt>
prompt.  After you <tt>halt</tt> the machine, a simple <b><tt>b</tt></b> at
the PROM prompt should boot the installed system.
<p>

<li>Now that the system has been fully installed, you may want to
add a line to <tt>MY-SUN3</tt> to automatically power up the
machine each time you start <tt>tmesh</tt>:
<p>
<pre>
% <b>echo 'command mainbus0 power up' >> MY-SUN3</b>
</pre>
</p>

</ol>

<a name="notes">
<h2>Notes, bugs, etc.</h2>

<ul>
<li>
The emulator doesn't keep time well at all.  The emulator process
itself yields whenever the NetBSD kernel <i>inside the emulator</i> is
idle; this is good because then the emulator process doesn't consume
all of the host's CPU.  However, the effective clock interrupt
frequency when the emulator is idling is much less than it's supposed
to be.  (I usually get 50Hz instead of the normal 100Hz.  This might be
some sort of Nyquist type effect, since the host's clock is only
running at the same 100Hz?)
<p>
<li>
<tt>tmesh</tt> has no <tt>quit</tt> command yet.  The only way to 
terminate the emulator for now is to Control-C it.
</ul>
