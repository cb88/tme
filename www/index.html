<h2>Introduction</h2>

The Machine Emulator, or <tt>tme</tt>, provides a general-purpose
framework for computer emulation.  The goal is to create a large
library of modules, each emulating a specific computer chip, or bus,
or board, etc.  These modules offer standard interfaces that allow you
to connect them together to create a whole machine emulation with a
minimum of effort.

<p>
While these assembled machine emulations will likely never be as fast
as a single program designed from the beginning to emulate a specific
machine, the standard module interfaces should be reasonably fast.
Even though the best abstract interfaces still introduce overhead and
can't always express certain optimization hints, reusability will always
save a lot of development time, and performance problems can be
addressed by faster hardware.

<h2>Getting the <tt>tme</tt> software</h2>

<ol>

<li>Download the latest version of <tt>tme</tt>:
<p>
<a href="tme-0.8.tar.gz">http://csail.mit.edu/~fredette/tme/tme-0.8.tar.gz</a>
<p>

<tt>tme</tt> can build without any third-party libraries or programs.
However:

<ul>

<li>If you have GTK installed, <tt>tme</tt> can use it to provide
framebuffer, keyboard, and mouse support to modules that emulate those
things.

<li>If you want to modify certain source files, Perl is required to
regenerate a small number of sources.

<li>Perl is also required to run a small number of utility scripts,
such as <tt>tme-sun-idprom</tt>.  However these scripts can be run
anywhere - not only on the machine running <tt>tme</tt>.

</ul>

<p>
<li>
Unpack and build <tt>tme</tt>.
<p>
<b>Note: the emulator is normally built out of plugin modules
<tt>dlopen</tt>'ed at runtime</b>.  If you intend to install the
emulation software under <tt>/usr/pkg</tt> or <tt>/usr/local</tt>, as
long as your <tt>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</tt> includes the relevant
<tt>lib/</tt> directory, everything should just work.
<p>
If you want to use the emulator without installing it, however, you
should use the <tt>--disable-shared</tt> option when running <tt>configure</tt>,
to build a statically-linked emulator that will do no <tt>dlopen</tt>ing.
<b>However, to run a statically-linked, uninstalled emulator, you must
have the environment variable <tt>LTDL_LIBRARY_PATH</tt> set to the top
of your build tree.</b>
<p>
<b>If your system has GTK but uses <tt>pkg-config</tt> instead of
a <tt>gtk-config</tt> script</b>, put the following <tt>gtk-config</tt>
script somewhere in your <tt>PATH</tt> and make it mode 0555:
<pre>
#! /bin/sh

module=`pkg-config --list-all | egrep '^gtk\+?-' | head -1 | sed -e 's/^\(.[-a-z0-9_\+\.]*\).*$/\1/'`
if test "x${module}" = x; then
  echo "$0: no gtk under pkg-config control" 1>&2
  exit 1
fi

args=
for option
do
  if test "${option}" = --version; then
    option=--modversion
  fi
  args="${args} ${option}"
done
exec pkg-config ${args} ${module}
</pre>
<p>
This is necessary because I make <tt>tme</tt>'s <tt>configure</tt>
script with an ancient <tt>gtk.m4</tt>, that predates
<tt>pkg-config</tt>.
<p>
Otherwise, this is a regular <tt>autoconf</tt> package, so do something like:

<pre>
% <b>sh ./configure</b>
% <b>make</b>
</pre>

Assuming the build succeeds, if you do want to install the emulator,
then do a <tt>make install</tt>.  The rest of this documentation
assumes that you have installed the emulator under <tt>/usr/pkg</tt>.
If you don't install the emulator, you'll have to find the programs
and files that are referenced in the documentation in the build tree.
<p>

<h2>Preparing your system</h2>

Full emulation of certain kinds of elements, like the Ethernet and
serial lines, requires certain permissions on the host running
<tt>tme</tt>.  If you don't intend to allow <tt>tme</tt> to access the
network or serial ports on your machine, you can ignore this
section.

<a name="system-bpf">
<h3>Ethernet access on BSD-based systems with BPF</h3>

<p>
The only Ethernet access method currently supported by <tt>tme</tt> is
the Berkely Packet Filter (BPF), usually available on BSD-based
systems.  If you want the emulator to be visible on your local
Ethernet, the emulator must be able to open a <tt>bpf(4)</tt> device
for reading and writing.

<p>
Normally, <tt>/dev/bpf<i>N</i></tt> devices can only be opened by
<tt>root</tt>, so you have one of two choices:

<p>
<ol>

<li>Run the emulator as <tt>root</tt>.  <b>This is not
recommended</b>, since the emulator won't give away its <tt>root</tt>
privileges, running as <tt>root</tt> the entire time.  Bugs could
cause it to do real damage to the host.

<li>Make a <tt>/dev/bpf</tt> device usable by the user that will be
running the emulator.  If this user is in group <tt>wheel</tt> on the
host machine, the <tt>/dev/bpf</tt> devices are usually group
<tt>wheel</tt>, mode 0600, so one solution is to make
<tt>/dev/bpf0</tt> mode 0660.  You may want to do something different.

</ol>
<p>

<a name="system-tty">
<h3>Serial line access on POSIX-like systems</h3>

<p>
On POSIX-like systems, <tt>tme</tt> can connect the real serial lines
and pseudoterminals on your host to emulated serial lines.  This is
always done with the <tt>tme/host/posix/serial</tt> module, which
takes a <tt>device</tt> argument with the name of any <tt>tty(4)</tt>
device you want it to use.

<p>
Usually, permissions prevent the user running the emulator from connecting
to the real serial lines in the host.  So, you have one of two choices:

<p>
<ol>

<li>Run the emulator as <tt>root</tt>.  <b>This is not
recommended</b>, since the emulator won't give away its <tt>root</tt>
privileges, running as <tt>root</tt> the entire time.  Bugs could
cause it to do real damage to the host.

<li>Make the device usable by the user that will be running the
emulator.  If this user is in group <tt>wheel</tt> on the host
machine, the <tt>/dev/tty</tt> devices are usually group
<tt>wheel</tt>, mode 0600, so one solution is to make
<tt>/dev/tty00</tt> mode 0660.  You may want to do something different.

</ol>

<p>
Pseudoterminals generally don't have restrictive permissions, so they
may be a more suitable choice for connecting to emulated serial ports.
You can use one side of a <tt>pty(4)</tt> pseudoterminal pair with
the <tt>tme/host/posix/serial</tt> module, however you must specify
exactly which side of which pair you want to use - the emulator won't
find a free pseudoterminal at runtime.

<p>
You should then be able to use any serial communications program -
like <tt>tip(1)</tt> - on the other side of the pseudoterminal pair to
access the serial data.  For example, I can have the emulator connect
<tt>/dev/ttyr0</tt> to the first emulated serial port on an otherwise
headless Sun 2, and with the following entry added to
<tt>/etc/remote</tt> I can use <tt>tip sun2</tt> to connect to the Sun
2's serial console:

<pre>
sun2:dv=/dev/ptyr0:br#9600:pa=none:dc:
</pre>
