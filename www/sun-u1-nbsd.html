<h2>Introduction</h2>

<a href="index.html">The Machine Emulator</a>, or <tt>tme</tt>, is a
program that provides a general-purpose framework for computer
emulation.  <tt>tme</tt> can emulate a Sun Ultra 1.
<p>

<hr>
<a name="getting">
<h2>Getting the <tt>tme</tt> software</h2>

<ol>

<li>
Find a fast machine to be the host.  The faster, the better.
<p>

<li>
Follow all of the instructions for getting, building, and installing
<tt>tme</tt> found under
<a href="index.html">http://csail.mit.edu/~fredette/tme/</a>.  If
you want the emulated Sun Ultra 1 to have network access, be sure to follow
the instructions about enabling <tt>tme</tt> to access the network.
<p>

<li>
Download the Sun Ultra 1 501-3082-update7 ROM, the SBus cgthree 501-1415 ROM, and the SBus cgsix 501-2325 ROM:
<p>
<a href="SUNW,501-3082-update7.bin">http://csail.mit.edu/~fredette/tme/SUNW,501-3082-update7.bin</a>
<br>
<a href="SUNW,501-1415.bin">http://csail.mit.edu/~fredette/tme/SUNW,501-1415.bin</a>
<br>
<a href="SUNW,501-2325.bin">http://csail.mit.edu/~fredette/tme/SUNW,501-2325.bin</a>
<p>
<b>If Sun asks me to stop distributing these ROMs, I will.</b>
<p>

</ol>

<a name="data">
<h2>Making the machine-specific data</h2>

It's best to create a new working directory for each emulated machine
you create.  This directory will contain the configuration files and
disk image for that machine.
<p>

In general, any working directory filename that begins with
<tt>my-</tt> or <tt>MY-</tt> is a file that is specific to your
individual emulated machine.  With the exception of the disk image,
these are mostly text files, and you are encouraged to edit many of
them to suit yourself.

<pre>
% <b>mkdir /some/where/my-sun4u</b>
% <b>cd /some/where/my-sun4u</b>
</pre>

<p>
Now populate this directory:

<ol>

<li>
Copy the <tt>SUN-ULTRA-1</tt> machine description file into the working directory:

<pre>
% <b>cp /usr/pkg/share/examples/tme/SUN-ULTRA-1 ./MY-SUN4U</b>
</pre>

This file contains <tt>tmesh</tt> commands that create a Sun Ultra 1.
If you don't change this file, it creates a Sun Ultra 1 with a
cgsix framebuffer, type-4 keyboard and mouse, one disk drive, one
tape drive, and an <b>unconnected</b> network interface.
<p>

<blockquote>
<b>WARNING</b>: Although <tt>tme</tt> enables the cgsix emulation in
<tt>SUN-ULTRA-1</tt> by default, this is only because NetBSD/sparc64
currently does not support a cgthree console.  The <tt>tme</tt> cgsix
emulation is <b>extremely poor</b>.  It's usable for the OpenBoot and
NetBSD console, but it will definitely <em>not</em> run X.
</blockquote>

If you can't use the emulated framebuffer (because, for example, you
aren't running X or didn't build <tt>tme</tt> with GTK), you must edit
this file to disable the GTK-based display and enable the serial
console instead.  Comments in the <tt>MY-SUN4U</tt> file should
explain how to do this.

<li>
Copy the ROM images into the working directory:

<pre>
% <b>cp /some/where/SUNW,501-3082-update7.bin .</b>
% <b>cp /some/where/SUNW,501-1415.bin .</b>
% <b>cp /some/where/SUNW,501-2325.bin .</b>
</pre>
<p>

<li>
Make a Sun Ultra 1 NVRAM file in the working directory:
<p>
The Sun Ultra 1 NVRAM contents are kept in a file.  Creating an 
initial NVRAM file involves writing a file with a specific number 
of zeroes.
<p>
<pre>
% <b>dd if=/dev/zero bs=1 count=8176 of=my-sun4u-nvram.bin</b>
</pre>
<p>

<li>
If you do want to use the GTK-based display, copy the Sun keyboards
map, and keyboard macros file into the working directory:

<pre>
% <b>cp /usr/pkg/share/examples/tme/sun-keyboards.txt .</b>
% <b>cp /usr/pkg/share/examples/tme/my-sun-macros.txt ./my-sun-macros.txt</b>
</pre>

You should not edit the <tt>sun-keyboards.txt</tt> file, however you may want
to edit the <tt>my-sun-macros.txt</tt> file.  The two files work together to
transform key events on your keyboard into Sun type-4 scan codes.
<p>

The <tt>sun-keyboards.txt</tt> file lists all of the symbols (in X
terminology, all of the "keysyms") on a Sun type-4 keyboard, and gives
for each keysym a Sun type-4 scan code and some modifier information.
Because Sun type-4 keyboards are never going to change, you shouldn't
change this file, even if you think it lists keysyms that your
keyboard doesn't have, like <tt>L1</tt>, <tt>R11</tt>, etc.
<p>

The <tt>my-sun-macros.txt</tt> file is meant to adapt your keyboard 
to the Sun type-4 keyboard.  Any keysyms that the Sun type-4 keyboard
has, that your keyboard doesn't have, can be generated by macros added
to this file.  For example, <tt>tmesh</tt> may complain that:

<pre>
[/display0.0]: cannot generate keysym 'R9' directly, or through a macro: No such file or directory
</pre>

The odds are good that you don't care about generating the <tt>R9</tt> key -
it's one of the keysyms on the strange, original Sun numeric keypad.  But
if you absolutely must be able to generate the <tt>R9</tt> key, you could
add a line similar to the following to your <tt>my-sun-macros.txt</tt> file:

<pre>
Alt_R F9 = R9
</pre>

Then, you could simulate pressing <tt>R9</tt> by pressing the right
<tt>Alt</tt> key and then the <tt>F9</tt> key.
<p>

The <tt>my-sun-macros.txt</tt> that you copied from <tt>sun-macros.txt</tt>
contains a small number of macros for generating the <tt>L1</tt>, <tt>L2</tt>,
etc., keys.  These macros should be sufficient for general use - simply ignore
the <tt>tmesh</tt> warnings about other, obscure keysyms.
<p>

Under X, to learn about the keysyms present on your keyboard, the
<tt>xmodmap -pk</tt> command will print out your current keyboard map.
Alternately, the <tt>xev</tt> command may be a more convenient way
to see what key combinations on your keyboard generate which keysyms.
<p>

<li>
Create the empty disk image file.  Decide how big you want the emulated
disk to be, in bytes, and substitute that number for <i>NNNNNNNN</i> below:

<pre>
% <b>dd if=/dev/zero of=my-sun4u-disk.img bs=1 count=1 seek=</b><i>NNNNNNNN</i>
</pre>

It's not immediately wasteful to choose a very large disk size - this
<tt>dd</tt> command will create a disk image that initially takes up
almost zero real space on your host's disk.  Only as the disk is populated
will your host's operating system allocate more real space to the image.
<p>

</ol>

<a name="install">
<h2>Installing NetBSD 5.0.1</h2>

Installing NetBSD in the emulator is very similar to installing it on
a real Sun Ultra 1.  This is good, because it allows developers to
experience and debug installation problems in the emulator.
<p>

<a name="install-iso">
<h3>Getting the NetBSD install CD-ROM image</h3>

NetBSD installation on <tt>tme</tt> uses a CD-ROM image.  While an
image of any vendor's NetBSD/sparc64 CD-ROM should work, only the
<a href="http://www.netbsd.org/Releases/formal-5/">NetBSD 5.0.1</a>
official sparc CD-ROM image was tested.
<p>

The CD-ROM image must be downloaded and stored on your host machine,
in your <tt>/some/where/my-sun4u/</tt> directory.
<p>

Download the official NetBSD/sparc64 CD-ROM image from a
<a href="http://www.netbsd.org/mirrors/#iso">mirror</a> close to you.
The pathname to the image is <tt>/pub/NetBSD/iso/5.0.1/sparc64cd-5.0.1.iso</tt>
or something similar.  You may also be able to download this image as a 
<a href="http://www.netbsd.org/mirrors/#bittorrent">BitTorrent</a>.
<p>

<a name="install-rd">
<h3>Booting and using the NetBSD install CD-ROM</h3>

Once you have an installation CD-ROM image, you must boot it.
<p>

<ol>
<li>
Start the emulator.  <b>Remember, if you're running a
statically-linked, uninstalled emulator, you must have the environment
variable <tt>LTDL_LIBRARY_PATH</tt> set to the top of your build
tree:</b>
<p>

<tt>% <b>cd /some/where/my-sun4u</b></tt><br>
<tt>% <b>tmesh ./MY-SUN4U</b></tt><br>
<i>ignore any <tt>cannot generate keysym</tt> warnings</i></br>
<tt>tmesh&gt;</tt>
<p>

The emulator itself is called <tt>tmesh</tt>.  <tt>tmesh</tt> is a
shell for running commands that create and control emulated machines.
One day, you will be able to create and manage a whole set
of emulated machines running inside the same <tt>tmesh</tt> process,
but for now it's only been tested to handle one machine.
<p>

<tt>tmesh</tt> takes one argument on its command line: the name of a
text file containing initial commands for it to execute.  In this
case, <tt>MY-SUN4U</tt> contains commands to assemble a Sun Ultra 1.
<p>

A new blank GTK window should appear on your screen.  If you
see any error messages, hopefully they're descriptive enough to help
you figure out what went wrong.  Usually, the first error listed is
the real problem; when a central element of the emulated Sun Ultra 1
can't be created, many subsequent errors will be generated because all
of the attachments to that central element also fail.
<p>

If you don't see any error messages, at this <tt>tmesh&gt;</tt>
prompt, give the <tt>ls</tt> command.  This should give the following
output:

<pre>

</pre>
<p>

If the output contains all of these entries, your emulated Sun Ultra 1
is ready to run.

<li>
The next step is to load the install CD-ROM image into the CD-ROM drive:

<blockquote>
<b>WARNING</b>: Unfortunately, the current release of <tt>tme</tt>
doesn't have true CD-ROM emulation.  Temporarily, the modules that
emulate regular disks are being reused to create a minimal CD-ROM
emulation.
<p>
What this means is that the CD-ROM emulation isn't very useful except
for installation.  For this reason, the CD-ROM emulation isn't enabled
by default in the configuration file, and you have to give these long
commands here to enable it:
</blockquote>

<pre>
tmesh&gt; <b>cd0 at scsibus0: tme/scsi/cdrom id 6 type tme-scsi-1</b>
tmesh&gt; <b>cdrom0 at cd0: tme/host/posix/disk file sparc64cd-5.0.1.iso read-only</b>
</pre>

<li>
Now you should be able to power up the emulated Sun Ultra 1:

<pre>
tmesh&gt; <b>command sc0 power</b>
</pre>

After a while (the Sun Ultra 1 PROM includes some unfortunate delays), you should see
something like this:
<p>

<!-- converting: xwdtopnm | pnmtopng -->
<img src="sun-u1-nbsd-0.png" alt="Initial PROM banner">
<p>

Because you started out with an NVRAM full of zeroes, the PROM set
the <tt>diag-switch?</tt> parameter to <tt>true</tt> and tried to boot
off of the network, which (assuming that you haven't enabled <tt>tme</tt> to
access and boot off of the network yet) failed.
<p>

Before installing NetBSD, it's best to set the IDPROM information
in the NVRAM.  The following procedure is derived from the
<a href="http://www.squirrel.com/sun-nvram-hostid.faq.html">
Sun NVRAM/hostid FAQ</a>.
<p>

First, you must choose an Ethernet address for your
emulator - <em>even if <tt>tme</tt> won't have access to the
network</em>.  Ethernet addresses for Sun workstations always begin
with <tt>8:0:20</tt>, so pick three hexadecimal bytes
<tt>XX:YY:ZZ</tt> such that <tt>8:0:20:XX:YY:ZZ</tt> is not taken by
any other machine on your LAN.
<p>

Next, set the IDPROM information with these OpenBoot commands, substituting
for the <i>XX</i>, <i>YY</i> and <i>ZZ</i> (note that there are two of
each):
<pre>
ok <b>1 0 mkp</b>
ok <b>80 1 mkp</b>
ok <b>8 2 mkp</b>
ok <b>0 3 mkp</b>
ok <b>20 4 mkp</b>
ok <b><i>XX</i> 5 mkp</b>
ok <b><i>YY</i> 6 mkp</b>
ok <b><i>ZZ</i> 7 mkp</b>
ok <b>0 8 mkp</b>
ok <b>0 9 mkp</b>
ok <b>0 a mkp</b>
ok <b>0 b mkp</b>
ok <b><i>XX</i> c mkp</b>
ok <b><i>YY</i> d mkp</b>
ok <b><i>ZZ</i> e mkp</b>
ok <b>0 f 0 do i idprom@ xor loop f mkp</b>
</pre>

Now you can turn the diagnostics switch off:
<pre>
ok <b>setenv diag-switch? false</b>
diag-switch? =        false
ok
</pre>

Now, tell the PROM to boot the install CD-ROM:

<pre>
ok <b>boot cdrom</b>
</pre>

After a short delay, the PROM should begin booting the install CD-ROM image:
<p>

<img src="sun-u1-nbsd-1.png" alt="Loading the INSTALL kernel">
<p>

Once the INSTALL kernel has been booted, the installation
RAM disk will display the first prompt:
<p>

<img src="sun-u1-nbsd-2.png" alt="The installation terminal type prompt">
<p>

<b>You do want to enter <tt>sun-type4</tt>, since <tt>tme</tt>
emulates a Sun type-4 keyboard.</b>  After that, <tt>sysinst</tt>
will start.
<p>

</ol>

<a name="sysinst">
<h3>Running <tt>sysinst</tt></h3>

Now you should follow the traditional
<a href="ftp://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/NetBSD-5.0.1/sparc64/INSTALL.html">
NetBSD/sparc64 installation procedure</a>.
<p>

Some notes and hints:
<p>

<ul>
<li>Depending on the speed of your host, it may take a while for
<tt>newfs</tt> to make filesystems, and for <tt>MAKEDEV</tt> to make
devices.  (This can be true even on a real Sun Ultra 1.)
</ul>
<p>

<li>When you're done with <tt>sysinst</tt>, from its main menu
select <tt>Exit Install System</tt>.  This will return you to
the PROM <tt>ok</tt> prompt, and <tt>boot</tt> should boot the
new installation.

<p>

<li>Now that the system has been fully installed, you may want to
add a line to <tt>MY-SUN4U</tt> to automatically power up the
machine each time you start <tt>tmesh</tt>:
<p>
<pre>
% <b>echo 'command sc0 power' >> MY-SUN4U</b>
</pre>
</p>

</ol>

<hr>
<a name="notes">
<h2>Notes, bugs, etc.</h2>

<ul>
<li>
The emulator doesn't keep time well at all.  The emulator process
itself yields whenever the NetBSD kernel <i>inside the emulator</i> is
idle; this is good because then the emulator process doesn't consume
all of the host's CPU.  However, the effective clock interrupt
frequency when the emulator is idling is much less than it's supposed
to be.  (I usually get 50Hz instead of the normal 100Hz.  This might be
some sort of Nyquist type effect, since the host's clock is only
running at the same 100Hz?)
<p>
<li>
<tt>tmesh</tt> has no <tt>quit</tt> command yet.  The only way to 
terminate the emulator for now is to Control-C it.
</ul>
